Please take a copy of the survey and an index card from the teaching assistants. 

Wait for further instructions before writing anything down.

## Instructions for the Survey

Please read these instructions carefully before writing anything down.

1. Introduce yourself to someone that you don't know.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides of the paper).
4. Also, write YOUR answer to question \#4 on the index card, and keep that, for now. You'll need it later.
5. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come to collect your survey.

Regarding Question 4, Professor Love is the large fellow standing in the front of the room.

## What is this course about?

![](images/describing-431-gears.png)

## What is this course about?

a. Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization
b. Statistical Inference, Making Comparisons
c. Linear Regression and related Models

The course is about biostatistics, replicable research, using state-of-the-art tools (R, R Studio, R Markdown), and thinking about how science is most effectively done.

- It is more a course in **how** to do things (highly applied) rather than a theoretical/mathematical justification for **why** we do them. We focus here on practical work.
- It's mostly about getting you doing data science projects for biological, medical and health applications.

## What is Data Science about?

## Teaching Assistants (email `431-help@case.edu`)

![](images/TAs-2017.png)

- All TAs work with PQHS/CRSP/MPHP students and both Sections.
- TA **office hours** start on Tuesday 2017-09-05 in Wood WG-56 (Computing Lab). Details to come.

## Gathering Some Data: Age Guessing Activity

- You will join one of ten groups, with 4-5 students in each group.
- Your group will receive a sheet to keep track of your guesses (estimated ages.)
- Your group will then receive one of a series of cards, with a photo of a person on it.
- For each card your group receives...
    + estimate the age of the person on the card
    + write your (group) guess in the table on the sheet in the row corresponding to that numbered card
- Later, you will be told the true ages and will be able to compute errors.

## Scientists Gather Their Own Data

If you have a little time between cards, make sure everyone in your group ...

1. knows the name and field of everyone else in the group, and knows your group's letter.
2. writes down a new guess as to my age on their index card, now that you know me better.

So if your initial guess was that I was 18, but now you think I'm 19, your card should read `18/19`.

## Age Guessing Robots?

Well, yes, of course, there's a tool online to do this. More than one, in fact. 

Visit \color{blue} https://how-old.net/ \color{black} 

Your mileage may vary, but that site's AI was 5 years too high on this black-and-white headshot of me. Do you think you did that well?

## Collecting the Results

We'll collect some key results in a Google sheet, that you should be able to reach when logged into CWRU for Google. \color{blue} https://goo.gl/ccgUS3

## And how did the AI at https://how-old.net do?
